## Overview

This is my first project ever, made from the beginning by myself based only on the picture from the Frontend Mentor challenge. I wanted to use knowledge gathered in last two months and show my best.  

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements
